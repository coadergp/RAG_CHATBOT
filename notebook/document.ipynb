Whichever \\nmethod is chosen, it will provide effective cooling \\nof the complete motor.\\nAir-to-water closed circuit cooling\\nThe cooling air circulates in a closed circuit \\nthrough the active parts of the motor and then \\nthrough an air-to-water heat exchanger. This \\nmethod is especially recommended if cooling \\nwater is available nearby. It is an ideal solution for \\nsituations where closed circuit cooling is required \\ndue to installation outdoors or in a hazardous \\narea, or whenever the quality of the surrounding \\nair is not suitable for direct cooling. It is also a \\ngood choice for motors installed in machine \\nrooms with limited ventilation, such as on board \\nships or in pumping stations that are fully \\nenclosed.\\nAir-to-air closed circuit cooling\\nThe cooling air circulates in a closed circuit \\nthrough the active parts of the motor and \\nthrough an air-to-air heat exchanger. This \\nsolution is generally used when a closed circuit \\ncooling system – such as air-to-water cooling – is \\nrequired but water is not readily available. An \\nadditional shaft-mounted or separate electric fan \\nis needed to ensure sufficient air flow through \\nthe cooler.\\nOpen air cooling\\nOpen air cooling can be used where the air in the \\nimmediate environment is relatively clean and \\nthere is adequate air circulation. The cooling air is \\ntypically drawn in through filters, passed through \\nthe active parts of the motor, and then exhausted \\nback to the environment. If the machine room \\nventilation system cannot compensate for the \\ntemperature gradient, the motor air outlet can be \\nducted to exhaust the air outdoors.\\nEnclosure protection classes\\nAvailable protection classes are IP23, IP44, IP54, \\nIP55 or IP66, or NEMA equivalents. Motors can \\nalso be supplied for hazardous areas in \\naccordance with IEC/ATEX or NEC regulations \\n(increased safety or pressurized construction).\\n10\\nSYNCHRONOUS MOTORS HIGH PERFORMANCE IN ALL APPLIC ATIONS'),\n",

These \\ninclude customer requirements and operating \\nconditions like ambient temperature, air \\ncleanliness, vibration levels and possible shocks \\naffecting the bearings. Also radial and axial loads, \\nrotation speed, coupling type and the type of \\ndriven equipment should be taken into account.\\nABB synchronous motors use quality sleeve \\nbearings that withstand high levels of vibration \\nand offer great performance. The bearings \\nprovide the same outstanding reliability under \\nstatic and dynamic (radial and axial) loads. Their \\nexcellent heat transfer capability makes them \\nequally suitable for low and high speed \\napplications.\\nEnd-shield mounted bearings are always used in \\nhigher speed (four and six pole) motors. Pedestal \\nmounted bearings are generally used for the \\nlargest frame sizes of lower speed motors. Motors \\nwith pedestal bearings are as easy to mount and \\nalign as those with end-shield mounted bearings. \\nThe motors are normally delivered ready \\nassembled and require no further assembly on \\nsite. Separate pedestal bearing motors are often \\nmounted on a common base frame.\\nSleeve bearings last as long as the expected \\nlifetime of the motor, provided that the operating \\nconditions and maintenance intervals are as \\nspecified. The bearing housing is designed to \\npermit easy access for inspection and \\nmaintenance. The bearings are insulated from the \\nmotor frame to eliminate circulating currents in \\nthe shaft, and the shaft can be earthed. The \\nbearings are sealed against oil leakage with \\nlabyrinth seals. Sleeve bearings are designed to \\nbe insensitive to misalignment and to permit \\nlarge axial play.\\nLubrication\\nIn some cases the bearings are self-lubricated by \\nmeans of an oil ring, which picks up the \\nlubricating oil and transfers it directly to the \\nshaft, forming an independent and highly reliable \\nlubrication system.\\nIn applications involving large loads, high speeds, \\nhigh ambient temperature or where the motor is \\nmounted in an inclined position, an external oil \\ncooling and circulation system may be necessary, \\nunless the oil is supplied directly from the \\nlubrication system of the driven equipment. In \\ncertain applications which run at slow speeds, a \\njack-up system may be required  for starting and \\nslow turning.\\nHydrostatic jacking oil systems are available for \\nlow-speed applications and, in specific \\nsituations, for use during motor start-up and shut \\ndown.\\nAccessories\\nWe offer a broad selection of accessories, \\nincluding devices and equipment for measuring, \\nprotection, termination, lubrication and \\nmounting of the motor. Typical examples are PT-\\n100 sensors, earth fault protection relays, surge \\narrestors, current transformers, rotor \\ntelemetrics, sole plates and anchor bolts.\\nA separate main terminal box is mounted on the \\nside of the motor, featuring bus bars outside the \\nmotor frame and allowing connections from any \\ndirection.\\n11'),\n",
